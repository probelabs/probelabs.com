<!-- The Real Problem (Dark Box) -->

        <span class="darkbox-label">The Real Problem</span>
        <h2>Your codebase grew faster than your ability to understand it.</h2>
        <p>At enterprise scale, knowledge fragmentation isn't a nuisance. It's a strategic liability that compounds every quarter.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="darkbox-right">
        <div class="darkbox-item">
          <span class="darkbox-num">01</span>
          <div>
            <h3>The Talent Trap</h3>
            <p>Three senior engineers hold the keys to critical systems. They answer questions all day instead of building. When one leaves, you lose years of institutional knowledge overnight. You can't scale expertise fast enough to match headcount growth.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="darkbox-item">
          <span class="darkbox-num">02</span>
          <div>
            <h3>The Coordination Tax</h3>
            <p>Payment team wants to refactor the billing service. Needs sign-off from Platform, Security, and three other teams who depend on it. Two weeks of Slack messages and meetings to understand blast radius. The actual change takes 3 days. The coordination took 20.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="darkbox-item">
          <span class="darkbox-num">03</span>
          <div>
            <h3>The Compliance Nightmare</h3>
            <p>Auditor asks: "Show me every place customer PII is stored and how it's encrypted." You know it's in 12+ services across 40+ repositories. Finding every instance takes a team 2 weeks. The actual audit question took 10 minutes. Your inability to answer it cost you a quarter's worth of engineering time.</p>

          <h3>Unified Code Intelligence Across All Teams</h3>
          <p class="capability-lead">Query your entire codebase — every service, every team, every repository — as if it were one system.</p>
          <ul class="capability-questions">

          </ul>
          <p>Most enterprises have knowledge fragmented across teams, Confluence pages that are 6 months stale, and Slack channels where context gets lost. Probe treats your entire codebase as the single source of truth. It reads code semantically across all repositories, understands cross-service dependencies, and connects dots between teams that don't even know they depend on each other.</p>

          <p class="capability-lead">Know where sensitive data lives, how it's protected, and prove it to auditors in minutes instead of weeks.</p>
          <p>Compliance at enterprise scale is a nightmare because the answers live in code that's scattered across 50 repositories and 10 teams. When the auditor asks "show me everywhere you store PII," you can't grep your way to an answer. You need semantic understanding of data flow across your entire architecture.</p>
          <p>Probe maps data lineage across your system. It finds every service that touches customer PII, traces how it moves between teams, identifies where encryption is missing, and generates compliance reports automatically. When regulatory requirements change, you know exactly what code needs to be updated and which teams own it.</p>

          <p>At 100+ engineers, onboarding isn't a people problem, it's a knowledge distribution problem. Your senior engineers spend 30% of their time answering architecture questions instead of building. New hires take 8 weeks to make their first meaningful contribution because understanding the system requires tribal knowledge that isn't written down.</p>
          <p>Probe gives every engineer — new or experienced — the same level of system understanding. It answers architectural questions instantly, shows historical context for why decisions were made, and guides engineers to the right code without waiting on Slack responses. Senior engineers stop being human documentation. New hires ramp up 3x faster.</p>

      <h2>What enterprise leaders ask us</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-grid">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does this differ from Copilot or other AI coding tools?</h3>
        <p>Copilot and ChatGPT work on whatever code is in front of them. They don't understand your multi-team architecture, cross-service dependencies, or organizational context. They can't tell you which teams need to approve a change or how a service failure cascades across your system.</p>
        <p>Probe understands your entire enterprise codebase — all teams, all services, all repositories — as a unified system. It answers questions that require cross-team knowledge and organizational context that generic AI tools can't access.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What about data security and compliance?</h3>
        <p>Probe is SOC 2 Type II compliant and can be deployed entirely on-premises or in your private cloud. Code never leaves your infrastructure. We support air-gapped deployments for maximum security. SSO integration with RBAC ensures only authorized users access specific repositories. Full audit trails for every query meet compliance requirements.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does enterprise deployment take?</h3>
        <p>Initial pilot with 3-5 teams: 4-6 weeks including architecture mapping, SSO integration, and workflow configuration. Org-wide rollout after successful pilot: 8-12 weeks depending on number of teams and repositories. Most enterprises see ROI within the pilot phase from reduced coordination overhead alone.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the ROI for an enterprise our size?</h3>
        <p>Enterprises with 100+ engineers typically see: 50% reduction in onboarding time (6-8 weeks down to 2-3 weeks), 70% reduction in cross-team coordination overhead (coordination cycles from weeks to days), 90% reduction in compliance report preparation (weeks of work down to hours), and 30% reduction in senior engineer interruptions (they build instead of answering questions). Most organizations hit positive ROI within 3-6 months.</p>
