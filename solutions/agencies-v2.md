<!-- The Problem - Storytelling -->
<section class="section section-story">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="section-header">
      <span class="section-label">The Real Problem</span>
      <h2>You're not selling code. You're selling trust.</h2>
      <p class="section-desc">And trust erodes every time your team needs to ask "where is this implemented?" or "why was this built this way?" or "who owns this service?"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="story-scenarios">
      <div class="scenario-card scenario-main">
        <div class="scenario-badge">Week 1</div>
        <h3>The Onboarding Reality</h3>
        <p>A new client signs. You assign your best engineers. They clone the repos, start reading code, and immediately hit walls. The architecture isn't documented. The naming conventions are inconsistent. There are five microservices but nobody explained how they talk to each other.</p>
        <p>Your engineers start asking questions. The client's tech lead answers a few, then gets busy. Questions pile up in Slack. Days pass. Your team is billing hours but not shipping code. The client starts wondering if they made the right choice.</p>
        <div class="scenario-stat">
          <span class="stat-number">2-3 weeks</span>
          <span class="stat-label">Average time to first meaningful PR on unfamiliar codebase</span>

        <div class="scenario-card">
          <div class="scenario-badge">Month 2</div>
          <h3>The Quality Drift</h3>
          <p>Your senior engineer who "gets" the client's codebase goes on vacation. The replacement follows different patterns. The PR gets approved anyway—nobody has time for thorough reviews. Small inconsistencies compound. Six months later, the client blames "agency code quality."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario-card">
          <div class="scenario-badge">Quarter 3</div>
          <h3>The Scaling Trap</h3>
          <p>The client wants to double the team size. Great news—except your current engineers are the only ones who understand the system. Onboarding new people means pulling your productive engineers into endless knowledge transfer sessions. You grow headcount but not output.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="story-insight">
      <p><strong>The pattern is always the same:</strong> Context is locked in people's heads. Getting it out requires interrupting someone. And every interruption—whether to the client or to your own senior engineers—has a cost.</p>

      <h2>One platform that connects everything</h2>
      <p class="section-desc">Your team asks questions in natural language. The system routes to the right sources—code, tickets, docs, history—and brings back answers with full context. No searching. No waiting. No interrupting anyone.</p>

        <h4>Intelligent Routing</h4>
        <p>The system understands what you're asking and automatically pulls context from the right sources—whether that's code, Jira tickets, Confluence docs, or Zendesk support history.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="diagram-feature">
        <h4>Code as Code, Not Text</h4>
        <p>Unlike generic AI tools that treat code as text, Probe understands code semantically. It knows functions, dependencies, call graphs, and ownership boundaries.</p>

      <div class="diagram-feature">

          <p>Probe maps the entire system. It understands which services depend on what, how data flows between them, and what happens when you change something. When a client asks you to modify an API, you'll know every consumer that needs to be updated.</p>

      <h2>What agencies ask us</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-grid">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is this different from GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT?</h3>
        <p>Copilot and ChatGPT work with whatever code is in front of them. They don't understand your client's architecture, conventions, or the relationships between services. They can't tell you that changing this function will break three other services, or that this pattern violates the team's coding standards.</p>
        <p>Probe understands the entire system—across all repositories, integrated with Jira and Confluence, aware of historical decisions. It's the difference between asking someone who just read the file versus someone who built the system.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does this work with legacy codebases?</h3>
        <p>Yes, and this is where it shines. Legacy systems are exactly where context is hardest to get—documentation is outdated, original authors are gone, patterns are inconsistent. Probe builds understanding from the code itself, not from documentation that may or may not exist.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do we handle different standards for different clients?</h3>
        <p>Each client gets their own configuration. Code review rules, quality standards, workflow automations—all customized per client and versioned like code. When a client's preferences change, you update the config and the entire system adapts.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the implementation timeline?</h3>
        <p>Basic setup takes hours, not weeks. Connect your repos, configure initial rules, start using it. The system learns and improves over time, but you get value immediately. Most agencies start with one client engagement as a pilot, then roll out across their portfolio.</p>
