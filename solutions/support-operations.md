<!-- The Real Problem (Dark Box) -->

        <span class="darkbox-label">The Real Problem</span>
        <h2>Support tickets shouldn't ping-pong between teams for days.</h2>
        <p>But every technical question means escalating to engineering. Context-gathering takes longer than the actual fix. Your team is flying blind, customers are waiting, and engineers are drowning in interruptions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="darkbox-right">
        <div class="darkbox-item">
          <span class="darkbox-num">01</span>
          <div>
            <h3>The Escalation Bottleneck</h3>
            <p>Customer reports payment failure. Support needs to know: Is this a bug? What changed? Which customers are affected? Without code context, every technical issue escalates to engineering. 70% of escalated tickets could be resolved by support with the right context. But that context is locked in code.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="darkbox-item">
          <span class="darkbox-num">02</span>
          <div>
            <h3>The Context-Gathering Tax</h3>
            <p>Engineering gets a ticket. They need to understand: What exactly is broken? When did it start? What changed recently? What did the customer try? Engineers spend more time gathering context than fixing the issue. Tickets bounce back and forth. Three days later, the customer is frustrated and the fix takes five minutes.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="darkbox-item">
          <span class="darkbox-num">03</span>
          <div>
            <h3>The Repeat Customer</h3>
            <p>Five different customers report similar issues. Each ticket is handled independently. Nobody realizes they share a root cause until the pattern becomes obvious. By then, you've wasted 15 engineering-hours investigating the same bug five times. The root cause was a single deploy three days ago.</p>

            <li>"What code changed in the last 7 days related to this error?"</li>

            <li>"Which components and services are involved?"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When a ticket arrives, Probe immediately analyzes it. It extracts keywords and error messages, searches the codebase for relevant components, checks recent deployments, finds similar past tickets, and identifies known issues. All of this context is added as an internal comment before your team even opens the ticket.</p>

          <h3>Code-Aware Investigation</h3>
          <p class="capability-lead">Support teams can ask "what changed?" and get answers without reading code — or waiting for engineering.</p>
          <p>Traditional support teams are blind to the codebase. They know what customers report, but not what the code actually does. This creates a hard dependency on engineering for any technical investigation.</p>
          <p>Probe gives support teams code-level visibility without requiring them to read code. They can trace customer issues to specific code paths, compare releases to identify regressions, understand feature flags and configuration, and identify which customers are affected by a deployment. All in plain English.</p>

          <p>Most support issues aren't isolated. Five different customers report the same bug, but nobody realizes they're related until it's obvious. By then, you've wasted hours investigating the same root cause five different times.</p>
          <p>Probe connects the dots across systems. It correlates Zendesk tickets with Jira issues, links customer reports to recent deployments, detects patterns that indicate systemic problems, and generates intelligence reports showing trends and root causes. Support becomes proactive instead of reactive.</p>

            <p>Install Probe and ask questions about your codebase in plain English. No code reading required. Get answers grounded in actual code with file references for verification.</p>

              <strong>You get:</strong> Instant answers to technical questions without engineering involvement. Support can investigate issues independently.

<!-- FAQ -->
<section class="section section-faq">

    <div class="section-header">
      <span class="section-label">Common Questions</span>
      <h2>What support leaders ask us</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-grid">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is this different from a traditional knowledge base?</h3>
        <p>Traditional knowledge bases are manually written and quickly become outdated. They capture what someone thought was important six months ago, not what's actually in the code today.</p>
        <p>Probe reads the actual codebase in real-time. When code changes, the answers change. When a customer asks about a feature, Probe checks the current implementation, not a stale document. It's always accurate because it's always reading the source of truth.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do support engineers need to learn to code?</h3>
        <p>No. Support engineers ask questions in plain English and get answers in plain English. Probe translates code into explanations: "The payment flow checks for valid billing address, then calls Stripe API, then updates the order status in the database."</p>
        <p>Every answer includes file references so engineering can verify if needed, but support can understand and act on the answers without reading code.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How accurate are the automated ticket enrichments?</h3>
        <p>Probe analyzes actual code, not documentation or guesses. When it says "this component changed 2 days ago in PR #1847," that's a fact pulled from Git history. When it finds related tickets, those are real Zendesk or Jira tickets with similar keywords and error patterns.</p>
        <p>The enrichments are designed to give support context, not to make final decisions. A human still reviews the ticket, but they start with relevant context instead of starting from zero.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the ROI for a support team?</h3>
        <p>Most teams see: 30-50% reduction in engineering escalations (support can resolve more issues independently), 40-60% faster average resolution time (start with context instead of gathering it), 20-30% fewer duplicate investigations (pattern detection catches systemic issues early).</p>
        <p>The exact numbers depend on your current escalation rate and the complexity of your product. Most teams break even within the first quarter.</p>
