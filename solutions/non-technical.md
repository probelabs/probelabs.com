        <h3>Understand Without Code</h3>
        <p>Ask questions about your product in plain English. Get accurate answers grounded in the actual codebase — no technical knowledge required.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="glance-card">

        <h3>Write Better Specs</h3>
        <p>Generate specs with constraints, dependencies, and edge cases automatically pulled from the codebase. Engineers can execute them immediately.</p>

        <h3>Resolve Tickets Faster</h3>
        <p>Investigate customer issues without waiting on engineering. Understand what changed, which components are affected, and what the fix should look like.</p>

        <h3>Keep Docs Fresh</h3>
        <p>Documentation that stays synchronized with code. When features change, you know immediately and can update docs before customers notice.</p>

<!-- The Real Problem (Dark Box) -->

        <span class="darkbox-label">The Real Problem</span>
        <h2>You shouldn't need a CS degree to understand your product.</h2>
        <p>But every question lands you in a Slack thread waiting for engineers who are buried in their own work. Days pass. Specs get delayed. Customers wait for answers. All because the knowledge is locked in code.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="darkbox-right">
        <div class="darkbox-item">
          <span class="darkbox-num">01</span>
          <div>
            <h3>The Developer Queue</h3>
            <p>You need to write a spec. But first you need context: How does auth work? What are the edge cases? Which services would this affect? Engineers are swamped. You wait three days for a 5-minute Slack call. Your sprint planning slips. The feature ships a week late because you couldn't get answers.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="darkbox-item">
          <span class="darkbox-num">02</span>
          <div>
            <h3>The Support Bottleneck</h3>
            <p>Customer reports a bug. You need to know: Is this actually a bug? Which component is broken? What changed recently? You file a ticket with engineering. They assign it. Someone investigates. Three days later: "We need more info." The customer is frustrated. The ticket bounces back and forth for a week.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="darkbox-item">
          <span class="darkbox-num">03</span>
          <div>
            <h3>The Documentation Drift</h3>
            <p>You write docs based on what you think the feature does. Engineering ships something slightly different. Customers follow your docs. Things break. Engineers fix the docs in code comments that you never see. Six months later, your documentation is 30% accurate and nobody trusts it.</p>

Database: Add indexes on filterable columns (user_created_at, account_tier, status). Constraints found: Current API returns max 1000 results — add pagination for filter results. Dependencies: Filter UI components can reuse existing FilterBar.tsx. Edge cases identified: 1. Multiple filters ANDed or ORed? 2. Empty filter results handling 3. Filter persistence across sessions 4. Performance with 100k+ records. Test scenarios: 12 cases generated including valid filters, invalid inputs, pagination, and performance tests.</div>

        <div class="uc-prompt">Three customers reported slow dashboard loading this week. Is this a new issue? What changed recently that could affect dashboard performance?</div>
        <div class="uc-response">Dashboard performance investigation: Deployment timeline — v2.3.5 deployed Monday 9am. Code changes affecting dashboard: PR #1233 added real-time activity feed to dashboard (loads last 100 events per page load, no caching). Database query analysis: New query runs on every dashboard load, joins 3 tables, no indexes. Impact: Accounts with >10k events see 3-5s load time (was <1s). Customer reports match timing — all after Monday deploy. Recommendation: Add caching layer for activity feed, limit to last 50 events, add database index. Estimated fix: 2-3 hours dev time.</div>

Database: Add indexes on filterable columns (user_created_at, account_tier, status). Constraints found: Current API returns max 1000 results — add pagination for filter results. Dependencies: Filter UI components can reuse existing FilterBar.tsx. Edge cases identified: 1. Multiple filters ANDed or ORed? 2. Empty filter results handling 3. Filter persistence across sessions 4. Performance with 100k+ records. Test scenarios: 12 cases generated including valid filters, invalid inputs, pagination, and performance tests.</div>

          <p>Probe investigates for you. It searches for recent code changes, checks for similar past issues, identifies affected components, and suggests workarounds.

      <h2>What non-technical teams ask us</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-grid">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need to know how to code to use this?</h3>
        <p>No. Probe is designed for non-technical users. You ask questions in plain English and get answers in plain English. The system handles reading and understanding code — you just interact with the insights it provides.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is this different from just asking ChatGPT or reading documentation?</h3>
        <p>ChatGPT has no access to your actual codebase and often hallucinates answers. Documentation goes stale the moment code changes. Probe reads your actual code in real-time, giving you accurate answers with references to specific files and line numbers. You can verify every answer.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will this replace the need to talk to engineers?</h3>
        <p>No, but it will make those conversations much more productive. Instead of "how does auth work?", you'll ask "I see auth uses JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration — what happens when a token expires during an active session?" Engineers spend less time explaining basics and more time on strategic design discussions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if the answers are wrong?</h3>
        <p>Every answer includes references to source code locations. You can verify information yourself or share with engineers for validation. The system is transparent about what it knows and where that knowledge comes from. When something is unclear or complex, it says so instead of guessing.</p>
