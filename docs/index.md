# Platform Documentation

ProbeLabs is **code intelligence + workflow automation** for product and engineering teams. Built for multi‑million line codebases and complex architectures, it powers search, reviews, and automation across your entire stack. PMs and support get answers without interrupting engineers. Reviews run automatically. Processes that used to take days happen in minutes. The bottleneck isn't writing code anymore — it's understanding it.

**Probe** is the context engine. **Visor** is the workflow engine.

## Start Here

### Pick your first workflow

- [Build an AI Assistant](/docs/quick-start) - Define skills, tools, and knowledge in YAML (~10 min)
- [Chat with Code](/docs/chat-with-code) - Grounded answers from your codebase
- [Intelligent Code Review](/docs/code-review) - Structured, guardrailed reviews in CI
- [GitHub Assistant](/docs/github-assistant) - Issue + PR automation in GitHub Actions
- [Engineering Process Automation](/docs/use-cases/visor-workflows) - Visor workflows for real processes

## Use Cases

Real workflows teams run every day, powered by Probe + Visor.
