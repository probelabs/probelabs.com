# Platform Documentation

ProbeLabs is **code intelligence + workflow automation** for product and engineering teams. Built for multi‑million line codebases and complex architectures, it powers search, reviews, and automation across your entire stack. PMs and support get answers without interrupting engineers. Reviews run automatically. Processes that used to take days happen in minutes. The bottleneck isn’t writing code anymore — it’s understanding it.

**Probe** is the context engine. **Visor** is the workflow engine.
